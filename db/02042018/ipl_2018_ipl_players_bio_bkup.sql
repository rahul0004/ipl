He may not have accomplished that in international cricket , but every time Narine came to bowl, he looked like taking a wicket. His bag of tricks - an assortment of carrom balls, knuckle balls and skidders - led West Indies to the World T20 title in 2012 - the first time they claimed a World trophy since 1979.\n\nHe was one of the chief architects of Kolkata Knight Riders\' two title victories in 2012 and 2014 - well worth the investment they put in him. He was bought at US $700,000 in 2012, promptly became the Man of the Tournament and has been retained by the franchise ever since. Narine once bowled more overs than runs conceded in a Twenty20 match, with 21 dot balls out of 24 in the Caribbean Premier League 2014. After nearly 650 overs, he went into IPL 2016 with 216 wickets at an economy rate of 5.52. Such highs were beyond him in the Test arena though; his last match came in December 2013 and his bowling average remains a dismal 40.52.\n\nNarine ran into serious trouble with his bowling action in the Champions League Twenty20 2014. He had to rework it once before too, in 2011, with the help of bio-mechanical experts at the University of Western Australia in Perth, prior to making his ODI debut in India. But it was in India that his career began to take a nosedive. He was called for a suspect action in back-to-back matches in the CLT20 2014 and was subsequently banned from playing the final in Bangalore. He was withdrawn from the West Indies squad, who were due to play the hosts in a limited-overs series of five ODIs and a T20 in October that year. Then he withdrew himself from the squad named for the 2015 World Cup, citing the need to keep working on his bowling action.\n\nNarine was lost to international cricket for over a year, but he returned to the West Indies side in November 2015 and ran into trouble with his action again. This time it was the ICC who were on his tail and he was subsequently suspended from bowling in international cricket. He was ranked the No. 1 bowler in T20Is when he was picked for the World T20 in 2016, but withdrew from the tournament to focus on his rehabilitation. In April, two days before the start of the IPL, his action was cleared by the ICC. \nESPNcricinfo staff \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/230558.jpg','Left-hand bat','Right-arm offbreak','West Indies,Barisal Burners,Cape Cobras,Comilla Victorians,Guyana Amazon Warriors,Kolkata Knight Riders,Lahore Qalandars,Melbourne Renegades,Sydney Sixers,Trinbago Knight Riders,Trinidad & Tobago,West Indies Under-19s','Sunil Philip Narine','Sunil Narine','Foreign',NULL),(1,'276298','West Indies','\n\nBy the time Andre Russell was little more than five years into international cricket, he was a two-time world champion. That both titles came in the T20 format defines the kind of cricketer he is. A batsman who hits the ball hard enough to make the inanimate thing scream for mercy, he functions primarily as a finisher. He generates even more pace with the ball in hand and when it is anywhere near him in the field, it doesn\'t matter at what pace it\'s travelling. Russell will probably get to it.

It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances.  \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/30045.jpg','Right-hand bat',NULL,'India,Abahani Limited,Albert TUTI Patriots,Delhi Daredevils,Gujarat Lions,India A,India Blue,India Under-19s,Indian Board President\'s XI,Kings XI Punjab,Mumbai Indians,Royal Challengers Bangalore,South Zone,Tamil Nadu','Krishnakumar Dinesh Karthik','Dinesh Karthik','Capped',NULL),(1,'311592','Australia','\n\nFirst there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia\'s attack for most of the past decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his older colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and his challenge was to take that white-ball form and perform just as consistently with the red ball. Starc struggled to gain the consistent backing of the selectors early in his Test career and was often in one Test and out the next, but in 2015 he finally enjoyed a solid run of Test cricket until an ankle injury stopped him during the home summer. Also a classy lower-order batsman, Starc fell one short of a Test century in Mohali in 2013.ESPNcricinfo staff \n \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/311592.jpg','Left-hand bat','Left-arm fast','Australia,Australia A,Australia Under-19s,New South Wales,New South Wales Second XI,New South Wales Under-17s,New South Wales Under-19s,Royal Challengers Bangalore,Sydney Sixers,Western Suburbs,Yorkshire','Mitchell Aaron Starc','Mitchell Starc','Foreign',NULL),(1,'322810','South Africa','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/322810.jpg','Left-hand bat','Right-arm medium','Dolphins,KwaZulu-Natal,KwaZulu-Natal Amateur XI,KwaZulu-Natal Under-19s,Lahore Qalandars,Leicestershire,South Africa A,South Africa Emerging Players,Sydney Thunder,Trinidad & Tobago Red Steel','Cameron Scott Delport','Cameron Delport','Foreign',NULL),(1,'326637','Australia','\n\nA prolific scorer when fully fit, Chris Lynn had his run-marking severely curtailed in 2014-15 and 2015-16, suffering serious shoulder injuries in both years. In 2014 he had surgery on his left shoulder to fix a rotator cuff problem and missed the entire Matador Cup and the first half of the Sheffield Shield season. In 2015 a near identical scenario befell him when he injured his left shoulder during a fielding drill and missed the Matador Cup - in which he was to captain Queensland - and the first half of the Shield summer. The timing was unfortunate for Lynn, who in 2014 had made his T20 debut for Australia and missed opportunities to strengthen his international credentials. Still, when he was fit he was he scored heavily, including a 250 against eventual champions Victoria during the 2014-15 Sheffield Shield, and as the BBL\'s leading run scorer in 2015-16 with 378 at 54.00 and a strike-rate of 173. A powerful striker, Lynn\'s T20 form has earned him deals in the IPL, SLPL and CPL. However, he was also an early developer in the long form, scoring a calm century in his second Sheffield Shield game at the age of 19.ESPNcricinfo staff \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/326637.jpg','Right-hand bat','Slow left-arm orthodox','Australia,Brisbane Heat,Deccan Chargers,Guyana Amazon Warriors,Jamaica Tallawahs,Kandurata Warriors,Kolkata Knight Riders,Queensland,Queensland Academy of Sport,Queensland Under-19s,Sunrisers Hyderabad','Christopher Austin Lynn','Chris Lynn','Foreign',NULL),(1,'32966','India','\n\nPiyush Chawla is one for early impact. As a 15-year-old he represented India Under-19 and Uttar Pradesh U-22. Before he made his first-class debut, at 17, he had already bowled Sachin Tendulkar with a googly in a Challenger Series match. In his first first-class season, he took 35 wickets and scored 224 runs to help UP win their first Ranji Trophy. In his teens he played two Test matches too, against England and South Africa. He took three wickets on ODI debut in Bangladesh in 2007, and 14 during India\'s tour of Ireland and England the same year, often troubling Kevin Pietersen with the googlies and the straighter ones. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/32966.jpg','Left-hand bat','Legbreak','India,Air India,Central Zone,India Green,India Under-19s,Kings XI Punjab,Kolkata Knight Riders,Rajasthan Cricket Association President\'s XI,Somerset,Sussex,Uttar Pradesh','Piyush Pramod Chawla','Piyush Chawla','Capped',NULL),(1,'35582','India','\n\nAs a batsman Robin Uthappa has always been attractive to watch, hard-hitting, with every shot in the book, and unafraid to hit the ball in the air.

Making his first-class debut in 2004-05, he quickly established himself by taking more than 20 wickets in each of his first three first-class seasons. Vinay soon added the inswinger to his repertoire, and his consistency earned him an IPL contract with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008. His first defining domestic season was in 2009-10, where he captured 46 wickets, besides mentoring his fast-bowling colleagues, Abhimanyu Mithun and S Aravind, to lead Karnataka to the Ranji Trophy final for the first time in 11 years.  Some good performances in IPL 2010 earned him a spot in India\'s squad for the World T20 in West Indies, but he has not been able to hold it down consistently.

The change wasn\'t smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong\'un among his variations. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/559235.jpg','Left-hand bat','Slow left-arm chinaman','India,Central Zone,India A,India Under-19s,Kolkata Knight Riders,Mumbai Indians,Uttar Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh Under-19s','Kuldeep Yadav','Kuldeep Yadav','Capped',NULL),(1,'6033','Australia','\n\nAn express bowler whose career has consisted of Himalayan peaks and oceanic troughs, Mitchell Johnson at his best was as fearsome as fast bowlers come. That summit came during 2013-14, when in successive series he cowed the batsmen of England and South Africa with his speed and aggression. In those eight Tests he collected 59 wickets at 15.23, along with a big bunch of cherries on helmets and gloves. Not surprisingly it led to Johnson winning his first Allan Border Medal, and at the age of 32 he was finally achieving the sorts of feats that Dennis Lillee might have expected when he first spotted Johnson\'s talent as a 17-year-old. There had been other highlights along the way for Johnson, including brutal spells against South Africa in 2008-09, but the lows of his 2009 and 2010-11 Ashes campaigns left his legacy looking uncertain. Nerves and family problems contributed to those struggles, but a broken toe in 2011 gave him time away from the game and the chance to reflect on where he was going. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/6033.jpg','Left-hand bat','Left-arm fast','Australia,Australia A,Kings XI Punjab,Mumbai Indians,Perth Scorchers,Queensland,Western Australia','Mitchell Guy Johnson','Mitchell Johnson','Foreign',NULL),(1,'604527','India','\n\nAn aggressive left-handed batsman who bowls part-time offspin, Nitish Rana was one of the shining lights for Delhi in an otherwise dark 2015-16 season, which was plagued by off-field controversies.

Under Dhoni\'s captaincy, India have won the top prize in all formats: the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/28081.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm medium','India,Asia XI,Bihar,Chennai Super Kings,Jharkhand,Rising Pune Supergiants','Mahendra Singh Dhoni','MS Dhoni','Capped',NULL),(2,'290716','India','\n\nKedar Jadhav is an attacking middle-order batsman from Maharashtra who came into the limelight with a 29-ball 50 for Delhi Daredevils on his IPL debut.

Purists might mutter about a lack of loop and flight, but he is very much a product of his times where short boundaries, heavy bats and shorter forms afford little latitude to slow bowlers. Bowling with a windmilling, whiplash action, remodelled after he was reported for throwing, he deals by varying his length and his pace, and can turn it the other way too. His deadliest ball, however, is the one that climbs wickedly from a length, forcing a hurried jab. In March 2001, it proved too much for the all-conquering Australians, as Harbhajan collected 32 wickets in three Tests, including the first Test hat-trick by an Indian, while none of his team-mates managed more than three.\n \nHis personal rivalry against the Australians has provided him both the highest and the lowest points of his career. Invariably, he has managed to raise his game against them, and been singularly responsible for Ricky Ponting\'s low scores on Indian soil - he dismissed him five times under 12 in the 2001 series - and some his punchiest batting performances has come against them too. But in 2008 his confrontation with Andrew Symonds created one of the ugliest controversies in cricket - he was initially charged with racial insult, which was reduced to abuse on appeal. Later that year, he was banned for whole IPL season for slapping Sreesanth, his Indian team-mate. When he channels his natural combativeness in the right direction, he can be a fiercely competitive and dangerous opponent. He was expected to be India\'s lead spinner in the all three forms of the game after Anil Kumble\'s retirement, but following a run of poor form was dropped from India\'s Test team for home series against West Indies and the tour of Australia in the 2011-12 season. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/29264.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm offbreak','India,Asia XI,Essex,India Green,Lancashire,Mumbai Indians,Mumbai Indians,Punjab,Surrey','Harbhajan Singh','Harbhajan Singh','Capped',NULL),(2,'297628','England','\n\nSam Billings, an energetic and inventive cricketer with a penchant for the limited-overs formats, and a fiercely-competitive all-round sportsman, made his England debut against New Zealand at Edgbaston in 2015, part of a new-look England side committed to adventurous cricket to banish the depression of a failed and conservative World Cup campaign.

Despite boasting an athletic figure made for photo shoots, Watson\'s frame was so brittle it threatened to break him. He refused to give up. Not through recurrences of back stress fractures, hamstring strains, calf problems, hip complaints, a dislocated shoulder or a suspected heart attack that turned out to be food poisoning. He changed his training, preferring pilates to weights, gave up alcohol, but not his dream. It finally paid off in 2009, when he was chosen as a Test opener in the middle of the Ashes series. Many batsmen would have been uncomfortable with the promotion from the middle order, especially after failing when given the job with Queensland, but Watson had become used to re-inventing himself. With a history of setbacks, it was not a surprise that his first Test century became such a drama, but after two scores in the 90s and an 89, he finally brought it up at the MCG against Pakistan - thanks to a single from a dropped catch. He had earned some luck. A productive few years as a Test opener led to back-to-back Allan Border Medals but by 2011-12, injury had again interceded. He returned to the Test team in 2012 but spent the rest of his career floating up and down the order in search of a place to call his own. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/8180.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm fast-medium','Australia,Hampshire,Islamabad United,New South Wales,Queensland,Rajasthan Royals,Royal Challengers Bangalore,St Lucia Zouks,Sydney Sixers,Sydney Thunder,Tasmania','Shane Robert Watson','Shane Watson','Foreign',NULL),(2,'849737','India','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/849737.jpg','Right-hand bat','Left-arm medium','Bengal,Bengal Under-14s,Bengal Under-16s,Bengal Under-19s','Kanishk Kapil Seth','Kanishk Seth','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'1064812','India','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/1064812.jpg','Right-hand bat','Legbreak googly','Rajasthan,Rajasthan Under-16s,Rajasthan Under-19s,Rajasthan Under-22s,Rising Pune Supergiant','Rahul Desraj Chahar','Rahul Chahar','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'1079839','India','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/1079839.jpg','Left-hand bat','Slow left-arm orthodox','Jharkhand Under-19s','Anukul Sudhakar Roy','Anukul Roy','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'1079860','India','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/1079860.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm offbreak','Rajasthan','Tajinder Singh Dhillon','Tajinder Singh','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'1081442','India','',NULL,'Right-hand bat',NULL,'India Under-19s,Punjab Under-19s','Mayank Markande','Mayank Markande','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'1132005','India','',NULL,'Left-hand bat','Left-arm medium-fast','Uttar Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh Under-16s,Uttar Pradesh Under-19s','Mohsin Khan','Mohsin Khan','Uncapped',NULL),(3,'230371','Australia','\n\nA fast bowler and productive lower-order batsman, Ben Cutting was on the verge of Test selection in 2011-12 when he was named in Australia\'s squad during their home series against New Zealand.

The Rajasthan Royals came calling during the second season of the IPL and he made a mark in his second game, smashing a half-century. His first tryst with the big league was when he was included as a back-up wicketkeeper in the limited-overs sides for India\'s tour of Zimbabwe, when the selectors decided to rest several senior players, including MS Dhoni.

He made a mark in the 2013-14 domestic season for Madhya Pradesh, scoring 835 runs in seven Ranji Trophy games, his best returns in over a decade of domestic cricket. He carried his form forward to Australia with the A side in 2014, scoring three consecutive centuries, including a double-century, in the first-class games. He was soon called up to the India Test squad in England as a replacement for the reserve wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. While he did not get a chance to play on that tour, he impressed with two hundreds and a double in two first-class games for India A against Australia A in Australia, followed by another double-ton in the Duleep Trophy.

It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments. Also a handy offspinner and outstanding fieldsman, he offers an impressive package in one-day and Twenty20 cricket. He made his name for Victoria with a 19-ball half-century against Tasmania in 2010-11, the fastest fifty in Australia\'s one-day domestic history, and has transferred that talent to the international stage.  At the 2015 World Cup he blasted a 51-ball century against Sri Lanka at the SCG, the fastest for Australia in ODIs and the second-quickest in World Cup history. It was also during early 2015 that Maxwell broke into the top 10 of the ICC one-day international batting rankings, which highlighted his improved consistency. Australia have also used Maxwell in Tests but to less effect - patience at the crease has not generally been one of his strengths.

He represents Delhi in domestic cricket, but first came to prominence when Chennai Super Kings, his second IPL team, began to use him as a pinch-hitter on the odd occasion. On turning tracks he can be a handful with his quick left-arm spin. In 2015-16, on the back of a good season in domestic limited-overs cricket, he was selected as India\'s fourth spinner for the World T20. A day later, on February 6, Negi grabbed the spotlight again when he became one of the four million-dollar buys at the 2016 IPL auction - the most-expensive uncapped buy ever at the time.

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batsman, it was his off-spin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann.\nWhile many critics dismissed him as a \"part-time\" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. He had also developed a doosra after working with his friend and sometimes Worcestershire teammate, Saeed Ajmal.\nBut it was his batting that stood out during his early Test appearances. He made an outstanding, unbeaten century in his second Test, at Leeds, as England went within two balls of saving the series and while he did unveil the first doosra bowled by an England spinner in the same game, he struggled to offer his captain the requisite control in the field with his bowling in his first three Tests.\nThat changed in training for the Lord\'s Test against India. Encouraged by teammate Ian Bell over the need to bowl quicker to survive in international cricket, Moeen benefited from a chance conversation from former Test off-spinner Kumar Dharmasena, an umpire in the series and an on-looker at an England training session, who provided technical advice as to how to achieve the extra pace without losing any flight.\nIt was to prove a pivotal meeting. Moeen was tighter at Lord\'s, devastating in Southampton and excellent at Old Trafford as he finished the series with 19 wickets; the fourth highest haul any spinner had claimed against India in a Test series outside the subcontinent and the best since 1967 when Ray Illingworth bowled 30 more overs and claimed one more victim. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/8917.jpg','Left-hand bat','Right-arm offbreak','England,Duronto Rajshahi,England Lions,England Performance Programme,England Under-19s,Matabeleland Tuskers,Moors Sports Club,Warwickshire,Worcestershire','Moeen Munir Ali','Moeen Ali','Foreign',NULL),(7,'940973','India','','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/940973.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm medium-fast','Hyderabad (India),Sunrisers Hyderabad','Mohammed Siraj','Mohammed Siraj','Uncapped',NULL),(8,'219889','Australia','\n\nDavid Warner is a hard man to keep quiet.

One of the most destructive hitters in world cricket, Warner opens for Australia in all three formats and in 2015 his seniority was recognised when he was named vice-captain to Steven Smith in the Test and ODI sides. It was quite a turnaround for the man who two years earlier had been suspended by Cricket Australia for punching England\'s Joe Root in a bar-room altercation in Birmingham, and had also been warned over a Twitter spat with a pair of journalists. It also completed a remarkable rise for a man who burst on to the international scene in 2008-09 as a Twenty20 specialist; he was the first man since 1877 to debut for Australia before playing first-class cricket. His breathtaking 89 from 43 balls on debut against South Africa told the world of his talent, but few at the time expected him to become a key Test player as well. \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/219889.jpg','Left-hand bat','Legbreak','Australia,Australia A,Australia Under-19s,Delhi Daredevils,Durham,Middlesex,New South Wales,Northern Districts,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Sydney Thunder','David Andrew Warner','David Warner','Foreign',NULL),(8,'25913','Afghanistan','\n\nMohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan.

No wonder then that once thrown the new SG ball, Bhuvneshwar can make it hoop around corners, mostly back into the right-hand batsman but he gets it to hold its line often enough to be a genuine threat. Like the other Kumar, though, Bhuvneshwar operates at a middling pace of early 130s, but India weren\'t spoilt enough for choices to deny him an international debut season at the age of 22, in late 2012.\n \nBhuvneshwar said a roaring hello to international cricket. In his first international over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India\'s first whitewash of a four-Test series. Apart from the swing, Bhuvneshwar\'s control of it and his cricketing smartness stand out. It stood out the time when he, as a 19-year-old, worked Sachin Tendulkar over for his first first-class duck in Indian domestic cricket. The cricketing smartness showed with the bat too when he scored 128 batting at No. 8, winning a Duleep Trophy semi-final in 2012-13, just before his selection for India.  \n\n','http://cricapi.com/playerpic/326016.jpg','Right-hand bat','Right-arm medium','India,India A,Pune Warriors,Royal Challengers Bangalore,Sunrisers Hyderabad,Uttar Pradesh','Bhuvneshwar Kumar Singh','Bhuvneshwar Kumar','Capped',NULL),(8,'326017','India','\n\nSiddharth Kaul, a right-arm pace bowler, began playing cricket in 1996 under the influence of his father, Tej, a former India physiotherapist and brother, Uday, who both played first-class cricket.

He scored an unbeaten century on debut and followed it up with four fifty-plus scores in his next five games for his new team. Bipul had signed up for the ICL in 2007 but his major assignment came when he was picked up by Kings XI Punjab in 2010. Despite not being a regular in the side, he was often employed by Adam Gilchrist to carry out the holding role during the middle overs. Bipul was not included in Kings XI\'s squad for the 2014 season, but got a lucky break when he was chosen by Sunrisers Hyderabad to replace the ill Laxmi Shukla for the 2015 season.

As a result, Sandeep was signed by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2013 season. In three seasons for his franchise, Sandeep not only took 39 wickets, but was regularly employed by his captain George Bailey to bowl the death overs.
